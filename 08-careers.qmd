The GEAM covers many variables concerned with the working conditions of respondents, including type of contract, complementary bonus, recruitment and training options, work-life balance, parental leave, among others.

Among the central dimensions of gender inequality in research performing organisations are work-life balance issues and fair career progression. Vertical segregration remains one of the most persistent gender inequalities in R&I: the higher on the career ladder, the less women. According to the most recent She Figures 2024 publication [@europeancommissionShe2025], women represent approximately half (48 %) of Doctoral (ISCED 8) graduates at EU level but only 29.7% of highest Grade A positions.

The overall result of fewer women at the top is the result of a many different factors contributing to an overall slower career progression of women.

For example, the analysis of the ASSET 2016 survey uncovered how differences between men and women regarding type of contracts, parental leave and others can have a cumulative effect on women’s careers and representation.

![ASSET Career path](images/ASSET_careerpath.jpg){#fig-career-path}

The GEAM holds several variables that contribute to an analysis of career progression and the potential disadvantages faced by women compared to their male colleauges. These variables are bundled under different question groups on working conditions, including:

- **Recruitment and promotion**
   + Encouragement to apply for promotion (`WCJC013`)
   + How did you obtain your current job (`WCJC014`)
- **Type of contract**
   + part-time vs full-time (`WCJC010`) with women usually being over-represented among part-time employees
   + permanent vs temporary contract (`WCJC011`) with (early career) women usually being over-represented among employees with temporary contracts (see also @sec-ch03-gaps-type-contract)
- **Training opportunities**, which are important for career progression
  + Training opportunities available and received (`WCJC019`)
  + Barriers to training (`WCJC021`)
- **Care responsibilties** are a crucial topic with regards to work-life balance issues and career advancement. Several question cover these: 
  + Care responsibilities for dependent adults (`WCWI006`) and children (`WCWI008` )
  + If care responsibilities for children exist, `WCWI009` indicates the number of children, and `WCWI010` status of single parent. 
- **Parental leave** covers policies targeting work-life balance issues. These include: 
  + Uptake over the past 5 years (`WCWI011a`) and type of parental leave (`WCWI011b`) taken; reasons for not taking leave (`WCWI026`)
  + Time since last uptake of leave (`WCWI027`)
  + Policies available before, during and upon return from leave (`WCWI016`); helpfullness of these policies (`WCWI021`) and overall preparedness to return from leave (`WCWI020`)
- **Work-family conflict** scale (`WorkFamConfISSP`) and several question on job statisfaction (`EWCS89JobSatisfact8` and `EWCS88JobSatisfact1`) as well as work intensity (`EWCS36WorkIntensity2`). For an example analysis of job satisfaction see @sec-ch03-gaps-job-satisfaction. 
- **Flexible work** arrangements
   + GEAM v2 included question `WCWI005` with several sub-items on flexible work arrangements (for an example analysis see @sec-ch03-gaps-flex-work). This section has been revised due to Covid and contains now dedicated question on flexible work options (`WCFlexibility`), frequency of teleworking (`WCTeleworkfreq`), reasons for *not* teleworking (`WCTeleworkNO`) and for teleworking (`WCTeleworkYES`) and possible improvements to working arranagements (`WCValuedAspects`). 

In what follows we introduce some of these questions in more detail, especially where questions require certain pre-processing steps or use existing measurement scales drawn from the scientific literature.  


## Care responsibilities

Women tend to have considerably more care responsibilities than men, both for children but also for dependent adults [@Gimenez-NadalGenderGapTime2020]. The GEAM covers both of these aspects using question `WCWI006` (dependent adults) and `WCWI008` (children).

: GEAM questions covering care responsibilities

Gender gaps in care responsibilities to both questions can be visually explored quickly using recipies and code introduced in @sec-ch02-respondents abd @sec-ch03-gaps.

For example,

```{r}
#| label: code-preprocess-wcwi006
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show preprocessing code for gender

df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |>
  mutate(SDEM004.bin = case_when(
    SDEM004 == "Prefer not to say" ~ NA,
    SDEM004 == "Non-binary" ~ NA, 
    SDEM004 == "Other" ~ NA,
    .default = SDEM004
  ))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-care-adult
#| fig-cap: Care responsibilities for dependent adults (WCWI006) by gender 
#| fig-cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to show code for following figure

cpal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, "Set1")

df.geam03 |> 
  filter(!is.na(SDEM004.bin)) |>
  count(Gender=SDEM004.bin, Adultcare = WCWI006) |>
  mutate(pct=prop.table(n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=Gender, y=pct, fill=Adultcare, label=scales::percent(pct))) + 
    geom_col(width=.8, position=position_dodge()) +
    geom_text(position = position_dodge(width = .9),    
              vjust = -0.5,    
              size = 3) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=cpal) +
    labs(x="", y="", fill="Adult children") +
    theme_light()

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-care-child
#| fig-cap: Care responsibilities for children (WCWI008) by gender 
#| fig-cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to show code for following figure

cpal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, "Set1")

df.geam03 |> 
  filter(!is.na(SDEM004.bin)) |>
  count(Gender=SDEM004.bin, Childcare = WCWI008) |>
  mutate(pct=prop.table(n)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=Gender, y=pct, fill=Childcare, label=scales::percent(pct))) + 
    geom_col(width=.8, position=position_dodge()) +
    geom_text(position = position_dodge(width = .9),   
              vjust = -0.5,   
              size = 3) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=cpal) +
    labs(x="", y="", fill="Care children") +
    theme_light()
```

In both @fig-care-adult and @fig-care-child we can see that women have more care responsibilities than their male colleagues.

For many subsequent analysis (e.g. in relation to the work-family conflict scale), we combine these two care-related variables into a new single variable named `CareResp` which is set to `TRUE` if a respondent is a primary carer for an adult **or** has caring responsibilities for children, and set to `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
#| label: code-create-bin-care-responsibility
  df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |> 
        mutate(CareResp = if_else((WCWI006 == "Yes" | 
                                   WCWI008 == "Yes"), TRUE,FALSE))
```

At this point we do not differentiate which type of care responsibilities respondents have, but simply if there are any gender differences at all. Using this newly created variable, we could explore if there are statistically significant gender differences for care responsibilities in this particular dataset using recipies for categorical variables in @sec-ch03-gaps.

```{r}
#| label: code-care-by-gender
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for contingency table

df.sub.01 <- df.geam03 |>
  filter(!is.na(SDEM004.bin) & !is.na(CareResp)) |>
  transmute(
    Gender = fct_drop(SDEM004.bin), 
    CareResp = CareResp
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-care-by-gender
#| tbl-cap: Contingency table care responsibilities by gender
#| tbl-cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for contingency table
# custom function to calculate different test statistics: chi-square, cramer, fisher
statsnote <- crosstab_stats(df.sub.01, "Gender", "CareResp")

# create the contingency table
df.sub.01 |>
  tbl_cross(
    row = Gender,
    col = CareResp,
    percent = c("row"),
  ) |> 
  bold_labels() |>
  modify_footnote_header(
    footnote = statsnote[[1]],
    columns = last_col(), 
    replace=F
  )
```

As @tbl-care-by-gender shows, there are no statistically significant differences in care responsibilities by gender.

## Parental leave

The frequency with which academic staff takes parental leave can differ by gender. Women often take more parental leave which can negatively affect their academic productivity and hence career progression.

The GEAM includes a series of questions regarding parental leave. To start with, `WCWI011a` and `WCWI011b` gather baseline data who has taken parental leave and which type:

+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Code       | Question                                                                                             | Responses                    |
+============+======================================================================================================+==============================+
| `WCWI011a` | Considering the last 5 years, have you taken or are you currently taking any form or parental leave? | \[1\] No\                    |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[2\] Yes\                   |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[3\] Prefer not to say      |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| `WCWI011b` | Which of the following forms of leave have you taken / or are you currently taking?                  | \[1\] Maternity leave\       |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[2\] Paternity leave\       |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[3\] Adoption leave\        |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[4\] Unpaid parental leave\ |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[4\] Paid parental leave    |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+

In addition, questions `WCWI016`, `WCWI020`, `WCWI021` gather further details regarding parental leave policies, return to work support measures and if they are preceived as useful.

cpal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")

df.prop.03 <- df.geam03 |> 
  filter(!is.na(WCWI011a) & !is.na(SDEM004.bin)) |> 
  group_by(SDEM004.bin, WCWI011a) |> 
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") |> 
  group_by(SDEM004.bin) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n),
         label = ifelse(prop > 0.01, paste0(n, " (", scales::percent(prop, accuracy = 1), ")"), "")) 

df.prop.03 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = SDEM004.bin, y = prop, fill = WCWI011a)) +
    geom_col(width = 0.8, position = "stack") +
    geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            color = "white", size = 3.5, lineheight = 0.9) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = cpal) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
    labs(x = "", y = "Proportion", fill = "Parental leave") +
    theme_light()
```

The chart presents the distribution of parental leave uptake by gender, categorised into three response options: ‘Yes’, ‘No’, and ‘Prefer not to say’. Among men, 88% reported not having taken parental leave, 10% reported having taken it, and 2% preferred not to answer. Among women, 86% responded ‘No’, 12% responded ‘Yes’, and 1% selected ‘Prefer not to say’. The distribution indicates a slightly higher reported uptake of parental leave among women compared to men. While the overall proportions are similar, the small increase in reported uptake among women may reflect differences in access, eligibility, or social norms surrounding parental responsibilities. Further statistical analysis would be required to determine whether the observed differences are statistically significant.

    ParentLeave = fct_drop(WCWI011a), 
    Gender = fct_drop(SDEM004.bin)
  )

  modify_footnote_header(
    footnote = statsnote[[1]],
    columns = last_col(), 
    replace=F
  )
```

@tbl-test-assoc-parent-leave-gender indicates that there are no statistically significant gender differences regarding parental leave (χ² = 0.736, p = 0.391 and Fisher’s p = 0.366). Furthermore, the Cramér’s V value (0.073) suggests no association, reinforcing the conclusion that the relationship between gender and parental leave uptake in this particular organisation is minimal.

Overall, these findings suggest that, within this sample, gender does not appear to influence parental leave uptake in a statistically meaningful way.

## Work-Family Conflict Scale

Existing research indicates the negative impact of work-family conflict in terms of heightened burnout [@KinmanLifeWorkJob2008], lower job satisfaction, diminished health and higher turnover intentions [@ZabrodskaBurnout2018] for academic staff.

The GEAM uses the Work-Family Conflict Scale [@breyer2016] is a well established measurement instrument on work-life balance that has been used in the [2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.11564) and [2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.12022) version of the Family and Changing Gender Roles module of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP).

Source: Breyer, B., and M. Bluemke. 2016. "Work-Family Conflict Scale (ISSP)." ZIS - The Collection Items and Scales for the Social Sciences. <https://doi.org/10.6102/zis243>.

The variable (`WorkFamConfISSP`) is composed of four items which are subdivided in two dimensions to measure how **work interferences with family** (WF) and how **family interferes with work** (FW).

::: callout-note
Note that for earlier version of the GEAM, the identification of sub-questions slightly changes from underscore "\_" to dot "." For example, to reference sub-question item one, the correct code for older version is `WorkFamConfISSP_SQ001` while for newer version it is `WorkFamConfISSP.SQ001.`
:::

There are national reference values available to deduce if respondents are below or above the national average of work conflict scale (see also [here](https://zis.gesis.org/skala/Breyer-Bluemke-Work-Family-Conflict-Scale-(ISSP)#Table6)).

### Preparation and pre-processing

In order to use the work-family conflict scale for a more in-depth analysis, several pre-processing steps need to be carried out.

#### Reverse coding {.unnumbered}

First, the scale needs to be recoded in order to ease interpretation. Original response items are coded starting with the lowest value representing the most sever work-life conflict "\[1\] = Several times a week" to the highest value representing the least work-life conflict "\[4\]=Never". The following code reverses the factor levels so that lower numers indicate lower work-family conflict and higher numbers will indicate a higher work-family conflict. In addition, we substract 1 from each score, so that "\[0\]=Never" coincides with a numeric 0. The [`fct_rev()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_rev.html) method from the [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/index.html) package does this job. We can conveniently convert all four sub-questions items with the `across()` function, which selects all variable names that start with `WorkFamConfISSP` and saves them into corresponding new variables `Rev_WorkFamConfISSP` using the `.names` argument. In addition, we need to convert the factor variables to numeric variables to calculate mean values for the scales in a subsequent step (and substract 1).

```{r}
#| label: code-reverse-wfc
# reverse factor levels
df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |>
  mutate(across(starts_with("WorkFamConfISSP"), ~ fct_rev(.x), .names = "Rev_{.col}"), 
         across(starts_with("Rev_WorkFamConfISSP"), ~ {as.numeric(.x) - 1}))
```

The order is now reversed where lower numbers indicate lower conflict and higher ratings a stronger work-family conflict.

#### Mean values {.unnumbered}

Since the work-family conflict scale is composed of two different dimension, we can calculate the average values for both, the work-family conflict as well as the family-work interference for each respondent. This will make it easier to produce summary statistics for the entire survey in a second step and explore potential gender gaps.

```{r}
#| label: code-wfc-mean-values
# calculate row means for work-family conflict scale
df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |>
  mutate(WorkFamMean = rowMeans(across(c("Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ001.","Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ001.")), na.rm=T), 
         FamWorkMean = rowMeans(across(c("Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ003.","Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ004.")), na.rm=T), 
         WFCMean = (WorkFamMean+FamWorkMean)/2) 
```

### Visual inspection

Since the Work-family conflict scale includes four sub-question items that respondents rate on 4 answer options, we use a Likert plot to get an overview of the overall distribution.

```{r}
#| label: fig-wfc-likert
#| fig-cap: Likert plot of work-family conflict scores for each sub-question
#| fig-cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to see code for producing the following figure
cpal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, "Set1")

df.geam03 |>
  select(starts_with("WorkFamConfISSP")) |>  
  sjPlot::plot_likert(values="sum.outside", 
              show.prc.sign = T, 
              expand.grid = T, 
              wrap.legend.labels = 17, 
              geom.colors = cpal)
```

As @fig-wfc-likert demonstrates, more respondents have difficulties to concile their work with family responsibilities than respondents where family interferes with work. For example, 73.3% of respondents indicate that they've "come home from work too tired to the chores" either "several times a week" or "several times a month". By comparison, a much higher percentage indicate that their household responsibilities does "Never" or "Once or twice" interfere with work.

We also see that the pattern is consistent, i.e. the upper two bars and the lower two bars exhibit similar percentages for each answer option. We would expect this consistency due to conceptualization of work-family conflict as a two-directional phenomena, where the upper two items measure the same family-work interference while the lower two items measure work-family intereference.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wfc-likert
#| tbl-cap: Work-family conflict percentages and total (N) for each sub-question
#| cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for producing precise scores
df.geam03 |>
  tbl_likert(include = starts_with("WorkFamConfISSP")) |>
  add_n()
```

Examining the mean values of work-family as well as family-work conflict confirms the visual result:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wfc-mean-values
#| tbl-cap: Mean values for main work-family conflict scale and two sub-dimenions
#| tbl-cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for producing summary table 
df.geam03 |>
   summarise(Total = n(), 
              'Mean Work-Family' = mean(WorkFamMean, na.rm=T), 
              'Mean Family-Work' = mean(FamWorkMean, na.rm=T), 
              'Overall Mean' = mean(WFCMean, na.rm=T)) |>
   mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, 2)))
```

The mean value for work-family conflict is considerablly higher (mean=2.06) compared to the mean value for family-work conflict (0.91).

Builing upon these insights, a more in-depth exploration of gender differences regarding work-family conflict could follow, for example exploring work-family conflict scores in relation to gender, age, or maritial status. Other interesting variables to examine in this regard include of course care responsibilities, `WCJC001` (current position), type of contract `WCJC010` (full- or part-time), or socio-economic background (`SDEM017` and `SDEM018`).
