abstract: >
    The following chapter provides an overview of the main variables and questions regarding work-life balance issues. This includes questions on parental leave options and policies, dedicated measurement scales on work-family conflict, as well as questions regarding employees care responsibilities for children or dependent adults. Using statistical techniques introduced in Part I of this book, selected analysis are carried out. The GEAM questionnaire includes many questions regarding work-life balance and thus enables a solid diagnostic of work-life balance issues and their related (gender) inequalities in organisations.

The GEAM covers many variables concerned with the working conditions of respondents, including type of contract, complementary bonus, recruitment and training options, work-life balance, parental leave, among others.

Among the central dimensions of gender inequality in research performing organisations are work-life balance issues and fair career progression. Vertical segregration remains one of the most persistent gender inequalities in R&I: the higher on the career ladder, the less women. According to the most recent She Figures 2024 publication [@europeancommissionShe2025], women represent approximately half (48 %) of Doctoral (ISCED 8) graduates at EU level but only 29.7% of highest Grade A positions.

The overall result of fewer women at the top is the result of a many different factors contributing to an overall slower career progression of women.

For example, the analysis of the ASSET 2016 survey uncovered how differences between men and women regarding type of contracts, parental leave and others can have a cumulative effect on women’s careers and representation.

![ASSET Career path](images/ASSET_careerpath.jpg){#fig-career-path}

The GEAM holds several variables that contribute to an analysis of career progression and the potential disadvantages faced by women compared to their male colleauges. These variables are bundled under different question groups on working conditions, including:

-   **Recruitment and promotion**
    -   Encouragement to apply for promotion (`WCJC013`)
    -   How did you obtain your current job (`WCJC014`)
-   **Type of contract**
    -   part-time vs full-time (`WCJC010`) with women usually being over-represented among part-time employees
    -   permanent vs temporary contract (`WCJC011`) with (early career) women usually being over-represented among employees with temporary contracts (see also @sec-ch03-gaps-type-contract)
-   **Training opportunities**, which are important for career progression
    -   Training opportunities available and received (`WCJC019`)
    -   Barriers to training (`WCJC021`)
-   **Care responsibilties** are a crucial topic with regards to work-life balance issues and career advancement. Several question cover these:
    -   Care responsibilities for dependent adults (`WCWI006`) and children (`WCWI008` )
    -   If care responsibilities for children exist, `WCWI009` indicates the number of children, and `WCWI010` status of single parent.
-   **Parental leave** covers policies targeting work-life balance issues. These include:
    -   Uptake over the past 5 years (`WCWI011a`) and type of parental leave (`WCWI011b`) taken; reasons for not taking leave (`WCWI026`)
    -   Time since last uptake of leave (`WCWI027`)
    -   Policies available before, during and upon return from leave (`WCWI016`); helpfullness of these policies (`WCWI021`) and overall preparedness to return from leave (`WCWI020`)
-   **Work-family conflict** scale (`WorkFamConfISSP`) and several question on job statisfaction (`EWCS89JobSatisfact8` and `EWCS88JobSatisfact1`) as well as work intensity (`EWCS36WorkIntensity2`). For an example analysis of job satisfaction see @sec-ch03-gaps-job-satisfaction.
-   **Flexible work** arrangements
    -   GEAM v2 included question `WCWI005` with several sub-items on flexible work arrangements (for an example analysis see @sec-ch03-gaps-flex-work). This section has been revised due to Covid and contains now dedicated question on flexible work options (`WCFlexibility`), frequency of teleworking (`WCTeleworkfreq`), reasons for *not* teleworking (`WCTeleworkNO`) and for teleworking (`WCTeleworkYES`) and possible improvements to working arranagements (`WCValuedAspects`).

In what follows we introduce some of these questions in more detail, especially where questions require certain pre-processing steps or use existing measurement scales drawn from the scientific literature.

## Care responsibilities

Women tend to have considerably more care responsibilities than men, both for children but also for dependent adults [@Gimenez-NadalGenderGapTime2020]. The GEAM covers both of these aspects using question `WCWI006` (dependent adults) and `WCWI008` (children).

: GEAM questions covering care responsibilities for dependent adults and children {tbl-colwidths="[15,50,35]"}

Gender gaps in care responsibilities can be explored quickly using code-recipies introduced in @sec-ch02-respondents and @sec-ch03-gaps. 


For example, by using @lst-crosstab-plot-code, we can generate stacked barcharts to visualise the relative proportion of women and men with care responsibilities. Note that this uses a binary gender variable, applying @lst-binary-sdem004-gender  before printing the plot.   

```{r}
#| label: fig-care-adult
#| fig-cap: Care responsibilities for dependent adults (WCWI006) by gender 
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to show code for following figure

df.geam03 |>
  crosstab_plot(WCWI006, SDEM004.bin, fillab="Dependent adult")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-care-child
#| fig-cap: Care responsibilities for children (WCWI008) by gender 
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to show code for following figure

df.geam03 |>
  crosstab_plot(WCWI008, SDEM004.bin, fillab="Children")

```

In both @fig-care-adult and @fig-care-child we can see that women have more care responsibilities than their male colleagues.

For many subsequent analysis (e.g. in relation to the work-family conflict scale), we combine these two care-related variables in @lst-create-bin-care-res into a single variable called `CareResp`. It is set to `TRUE` if a respondent is a primary carer for an adult **or** has caring responsibilities for children, and set to `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-create-bin-care-res
#| lst-cap: Merge Adult and Child care responsibilities into a new variable 'CareResp'
  df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |> 
        mutate(CareResp = if_else((WCWI006 == "Yes" | 
                                   WCWI008 == "Yes"), TRUE,FALSE))
```

At this point we do not differentiate which type of care responsibilities respondents have. Using the newly created `CareResp` variable we check if there exist statistically significant gender differences for care responsibilities in our dataset (see @sec-ch03-gaps-categorical). 

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-care-by-gender
#| lst-cap: Drop rows containing NA and unused factor levels
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code

df.sub.01 <- df.geam03 |>
  filter(!is.na(SDEM004.bin) & !is.na(CareResp)) |>
  transmute(
    Gender = fct_drop(SDEM004.bin), 
    CareResp = CareResp
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-care-by-gender
#| tbl-cap: Contingency table care responsibilities by gender
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for contingency table
# custom function to calculate different test statistics: chi-square, cramer, fisher
statsnote <- crosstab_stats(df.sub.01, "Gender", "CareResp")

# create the contingency table
df.sub.01 |>
  tbl_cross(
    row = Gender,
    col = CareResp,
    percent = c("row"),
  ) |> 
  bold_labels() |>
  modify_footnote_header(
    footnote = statsnote[[1]],
    columns = last_col(), 
    replace=F
  )
```

As @tbl-care-by-gender shows, gender differences in care responsibilities tend to be significant at the p < 0.05 signifance level. As @fig-care-adult shows, the difference concerns mainly care responsibilities for dependent adults, where men have fewer care responsibilities than women. 

## Parental leave

The frequency with which academic staff takes parental leave can differ by gender. Women often take more parental leave which can negatively affect their academic productivity and hence career progression.

The GEAM includes a series of questions regarding parental leave. To start with, `WCWI011a` and `WCWI011b` gather baseline data who has taken parental leave and which type:

+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| Code       | Question                                                                                             | Responses                    |
+============+======================================================================================================+==============================+
| `WCWI011a` | Considering the last 5 years, have you taken or are you currently taking any form or parental leave? | \[1\] No\                    |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[2\] Yes\                   |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[3\] Prefer not to say      |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| `WCWI011b` | Which of the following forms of leave have you taken / or are you currently taking?                  | \[1\] Maternity leave\       |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[2\] Paternity leave\       |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[3\] Adoption leave\        |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[4\] Unpaid parental leave\ |
|            |                                                                                                      | \[4\] Paid parental leave    |
+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+

: Care responsibilities question {tbl-colwidths="[15,45,30]"}

In addition, questions `WCWI016`, `WCWI020`, `WCWI021` gather further details regarding parental leave policies, return to work support measures and if they are preceived as useful.

```{r}
#| label: fig-leave-gender
#| fig.cap: "Stacked bar chart of parental leave uptake by gender"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to show code for illustration

df.geam03 |>
  crosstab_plot(WCWI011a, SDEM004.bin, fillab="Parental leave")

```

The chart presents the distribution of parental leave uptake by gender, categorised into three response options: ‘Yes’, ‘No’, and ‘Prefer not to say’. Among men, 88% reported not having taken parental leave, 10% reported having taken it, and 2% preferred not to answer. Among women, 86% responded ‘No’, 12% responded ‘Yes’, and 1% selected ‘Prefer not to say’. The distribution indicates a slightly higher reported uptake of parental leave among women compared to men. While the overall proportions are similar, the small increase in reported uptake among women may reflect differences in access, eligibility, or social norms surrounding parental responsibilities. 

In a subsequent step, further statistical analysis shows whether the observed differences are statistically significant. For that we also remove the 'Prefer not to say' answer option from parental leave (`WCWI011a`) which contains too few respondents and all respondents with now answer.  

```{r}
#| label: tbl-test-assoc-parent-leave-gender
#| tbl-cap: "Statistical test results - Association between parental leave and gender"
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Click to see code to generate contingency table
# drop unused factor levels
df.sub.03 <- df.geam03 |>
  mutate(ParentLeave = if_else(WCWI011a == "Prefer not to say", NA_character_, WCWI011a)) |>
  filter(!is.na(ParentLeave) & !is.na(SDEM004.bin)) |>
  transmute(
    ParentLeave = fct_drop(ParentLeave), 
    Gender = fct_drop(SDEM004.bin)
  )

# custom function to calculate different test statistics
statsnote <- crosstab_stats(df.sub.03, "Gender", "ParentLeave")

# create the contingency table
df.sub.03 |>
  tbl_cross(
    row = Gender,
    col = ParentLeave,
    percent = c("row"),
  ) |> 
  bold_labels() |>
  modify_footnote_header(
    footnote = statsnote[[1]],
    columns = last_col(), 
    replace=F
  )
```

@tbl-test-assoc-parent-leave-gender indicates that there are no statistically significant gender differences regarding parental leave (χ² = 0.344, p = 0.557 and Fisher’s p = 0.579). Furthermore, the Cramér’s V value (0.029) suggests no association, reinforcing the conclusion that the relationship between gender and parental leave uptake in this particular organisation is minimal.

Overall, these findings suggest that, within this sample, gender does not appear to influence parental leave uptake in a statistically meaningful way.

## Work-Family Conflict Scale

Existing research indicates the negative impact of work-family conflict in terms of heightened burnout [@KinmanLifeWorkJob2008], lower job satisfaction, diminished health and higher turnover intentions [@ZabrodskaBurnout2018] for academic staff.

The GEAM uses the Work-Family Conflict Scale [@breyer2016] which is a well established measurement instrument on work-life balance that has been used in the [2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.11564) and [2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.12022) version of the Family and Changing Gender Roles module of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP).

Source: Breyer, B., and M. Bluemke. 2016. "Work-Family Conflict Scale (ISSP)." ZIS - The Collection Items and Scales for the Social Sciences. <https://doi.org/10.6102/zis243>.

The variable (`WorkFamConfISSP`) is composed of four items which are subdivided in two dimensions to measure how **work interferences with family** (WF) and how **family interferes with work** (FW).

: Work-family conflict scale {tbl-colwidths="[10,40,20,35]"}

::: callout-note
Note that for earlier version of the GEAM, the identification of sub-questions slightly changes from underscore "\_" to dot "." For example, to reference sub-question item one, the correct code for older version is `WorkFamConfISSP_SQ001` while for newer version it is `WorkFamConfISSP.SQ001.`
:::

In addition, there are national reference values available to deduce if respondents are below or above the national average of work conflict (see also [here](https://zis.gesis.org/skala/Breyer-Bluemke-Work-Family-Conflict-Scale-(ISSP)#Table6)).


### Preparation and pre-processing

In order to use the work-family conflict scale for a more in-depth analysis, several pre-processing steps need to be carried out.

#### Reverse coding {.unnumbered}

First, the scale needs to be recoded in order to ease interpretation. Original response items are coded starting with the lowest value representing the most sever work-life conflict "\[1\] = Several times a week" to the highest value representing the least work-life conflict "\[4\]=Never". The following code reverses the factor levels so that lower numers indicate lower work-family conflict and higher numbers will indicate a higher work-family conflict. In addition, we substract 1 from each score, so that "\[0\]=Never" coincides with a numeric 0. The [`fct_rev()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_rev.html) method from the [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/index.html) package does this job. We can conveniently convert all four sub-questions items with the `across()` function, which selects all variable names that start with `WorkFamConfISSP` and saves them into corresponding new variables `Rev_WorkFamConfISSP` using the `.names` argument. In addition, we need to convert the factor variables to numeric variables to calculate mean values for the scales in a subsequent step (and substract 1).

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-reverse-wfc
#| lst-cap: Reverse code work-family conflict items and convert to numeric
# reverse factor levels
df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |>
  mutate(across(starts_with("WorkFamConfISSP"), ~ fct_rev(.x), .names = "Rev_{.col}"), 
         across(starts_with("Rev_WorkFamConfISSP"), ~ {as.numeric(.x) - 1}))
```

The order is now reversed where lower numbers indicate lower conflict and higher ratings a stronger work-family conflict.

#### Mean values {.unnumbered}

Since the work-family conflict scale is composed of two different dimension, we can calculate the average values for both, the work-family conflict as well as the family-work interference for each respondent. This will make it easier to produce summary statistics for the entire survey in a second step and explore potential gender gaps.

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-wfc-mean-values
#| lst-cap: Calculate row means for work-family conflict scale for WF and FW sub-dimensions
# calculate row means for work-family conflict scale
df.geam03 <- df.geam03 |>
  mutate(WorkFamMean = rowMeans(across(c("Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ001.","Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ001.")), na.rm=T), 
         FamWorkMean = rowMeans(across(c("Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ003.","Rev_WorkFamConfISSP.SQ004.")), na.rm=T), 
         WFCMean = (WorkFamMean+FamWorkMean)/2) 
```


### Exploring patterns

Since the Work-family conflict scale includes four sub-question items that respondents rate on 4 answer options, we use a Likert plot to get an overview of the overall distribution.

```{r}
#| label: fig-wfc-likert
#| fig-cap: Likert plot of work-family conflict scores for each sub-question
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for figure

cpal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, "Set1")

df.geam03 |>
  select(starts_with("WorkFamConfISSP")) |>  
  sjPlot::plot_likert(values="sum.outside", 
              show.prc.sign = T,
              grid.range = c(1.1, 1.1),
              expand.grid = T, 
              wrap.legend.labels = 10, 
              geom.colors = cpal)
```

As @fig-wfc-likert demonstrates, more respondents have difficulties to concile their work with family responsibilities than respondents where family interferes with work. For example, 60.9% of respondents indicate that they've "come home from work too tired to the chores" either "several times a week" or "several times a month". By comparison, 87.9% of respondents indicate that their household responsibilities do "Never" or "Once or twice" interfere with work.

We also see that the pattern is consistent, i.e. the upper two bars and the lower two bars exhibit similar percentages for each answer option. We would expect this consistency due to conceptualization of work-family conflict as a two-directional phenomena, where the upper two items measure the same family-work interference while the lower two items measure work-family intereference.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wfc-likert
#| tbl-cap: Work-family conflict percentages and total (N) for each sub-question
#| cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for producing precise scores
df.geam03 |>
  tbl_likert(include = starts_with("WorkFamConfISSP")) |>
  add_n()
```

Examining the mean values of work-family as well as family-work conflict confirms the visual result:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wfc-mean-values
#| tbl-cap: Mean values for main work-family conflict scale and two sub-dimenions
#| tbl-cap-location: margin
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Show code for producing summary table 
df.geam03 |>
   summarise(Total = n(), 
              'Mean Work-Family' = mean(WorkFamMean, na.rm=T), 
              'Mean Family-Work' = mean(FamWorkMean, na.rm=T), 
              'Overall Mean' = mean(WFCMean, na.rm=T)) |>
   mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, 2)))
```

The mean value for work-family conflict is considerablly higher (mean=1.8) compared to the mean value for family-work conflict (0.62).

Builing upon these insights, a more in-depth exploration of gender differences regarding work-family conflict could follow, for example exploring work-family conflict scores in relation to gender, age, or maritial status. Other interesting variables to examine in this regard include of course care responsibilities, `WCJC001` (current position), type of contract `WCJC010` (full- or part-time), or socio-economic background (`SDEM017` and `SDEM018`).
