# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book offers practical, in-depth guidance on analyzing data collected through the Gender Equality Audit and Monitoring (GEAM) questionnaire. It aims to inspire and equip users to move beyond basic descriptive statistics, encouraging deeper exploration of the thematic issues underlying gender equality.

It is intended for members of gender equality working groups, including professionals, gender specialists, administrative staff, and other stakeholders who have collected data using GEAM in their organisations but are uncertain about how to analyse it in greater depth.

Each chapter represents a collaboration between gender equality practitioners and academic statisticians and data analysts. Cases use real-world data from different Higher Eduaction organisations across Europe. Running thematic analysis side by side with the R code used, faciliates to kick-start similar analysis in different organisations.

The statistical analyses presented in this manual encompass methodologies ranging from univariate and bivariate analyses to describe general patterns, to more advanced techniques such as multivariate analysis, logistic and linear regressions, hypothesis testing, and others. Modern data visualisation tools are also covered, enabling results to be represented in a clear and accessible manner. All of this aims to equip users with analytical skills to extract meaningful and evidence-based conclusions, essential for implementing policies and actions to promote gender equality.

The development of GEAM questionnaire began during the ACT project [Communities of PrACTice for Accelerating Gender Equality and Institutional Change in Research and Innovation across Europe (2018–2021)](https://www.act-on-gender.eu/). Subsequently, as part of the INSPIRE project [Building Europe’s Centre of Excellence on Inclusive Gender Equality in R&I](https://www.inspirequality.eu/), the GEAM tool has been adapted to better address the needs of academics, administrative staff, and university students across various organisations.

In this manual, users will find not only a technical resource but also a starting point for fostering an organisational culture rooted in gender equality through informed analysis and evidence-based decision-making.
